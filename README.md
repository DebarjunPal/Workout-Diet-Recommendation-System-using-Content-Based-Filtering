# Workout & Diet Recommendation System — Content-Based Filtering 💪🍎

A compact, easy-to-follow implementation of a content-based recommendation system that suggests workout routines and diet plans. The full implementation and walkthrough are provided as an interactive Jupyter Notebook for exploration and experimentation. 🚀

## What's in this repository 📁
- Workout & Diet Recommendation System using Content Based Filtering.ipynb  
  - A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation, explanations, and example runs.  
  - (Open the notebook to view code cells, visualizations, and sample recommendations.)

## Project summary — what this does 🧠
This project demonstrates how to build a content-based recommender for fitness:
- Represents workout and diet items using descriptive features (e.g., attributes and tags).
- Computes similarity between items based on those features.
- Recommends items (workouts or diets) similar to a given seed item or user preference.
- Delivered as a reproducible Jupyter Notebook so you can run, inspect, and modify each step. 🔍

---

## Why this is useful 🎯
- Teaches the core idea of content-based filtering in a practical domain (fitness & nutrition).
- Useful as a learning resource, a prototype for a fitness app, or a starting point to build production systems.
- Notebook format makes it easy to experiment with new features and datasets.

## How to run the notebook 🛠️
1. Open the notebook file: Workout & Diet Recommendation System using Content Based Filtering.ipynb  
2. Run it in any standard environment:
   - Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab, or
   - Google Colab (upload/open the notebook)
3. Step through the cells to reproduce data processing, similarity computation, and example recommendations.  
Tip: Run cells sequentially so outputs and visualizations appear as intended. ▶️

## Key components to look for inside the notebook 🔎
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Feature construction (how items are represented)
- Similarity calculation (how recommendations are derived)
- Example queries showing recommended workouts/diets
- Inline explanations to help you follow the approach
